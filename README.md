## About 

This project was created to test GitHub Copilot. It is a simple app fully generated by the tool, based on instructions written by me. 

The results amazed me, because I didn't even touch the code, and yet something working could be done within a few minutes.

## Instructions

- Create a simple app that creates a business card based on the informations provided by the user
- The app should be created with HTML, CSS and Javascript
- The CSS and javascript should be embedded in the html file
- Style with tailwindcss
- Enable the application to use portuguese special characters
- When the app starts, there should only be a header and two buttons so that the user can choose the language of the application
- The header should have the text "Simple Business Card Generator" and be centralized
- The two buttons should be "Portuguese" and "English"
- If portuguese is chosen, use portuguese from Brazil       
- When the user clicks a button, a prompt should appear asking for the user's name, occupation and email in the chosen language
- The prompt should have a label and an input for each of the informations 
- The card should have a border, shadow and padding 
- The card should be centered on the screen
- The card should have fixed width and height
- The card should have a title with the user's name, a subtitle with the user's occupation and a footer with the user's email as a link
